# Notes from Zach M.

## Over the Rainbow

This was a transcription, created by composer Harold Arlen and lyricist Yip Harburg. 

A link to the repo is [here](https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-zachmiller-ucsb).

To play this piece, run the command ./run.sh tutorials/audiovisual/overtherainbow_visual.cpp and press 'c'.

In this piece, I was exploring some of the audiovisual components of allolib, and messing around with a few parameters. I was also changing some dynamics as well as chord voicings to see if I could build off of my initial transcription.

## Some noises

This was an original piece, located in the same repo [here](https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-zachmiller-ucsb) as linked above.

To play this piece, run the command ./run.sh tutorials/synthesis/demo3.cpp and press the keys 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e' to play various sounds. There is no real performance component, since the piece lags out on (if you're lucky) the fifth key stroke.

In this piece, I was trying to extend the capabilities of allolib by allowing a user to dynamically load in presets and create a piece which accesses a wide variety of synthesized sounds, without all of the hassle of changing trigger parameters. I have been trying for a while now to fix the bug where this piece lags out after a few voices have been triggered, but have had no luck as of yet.

## (REALLY) Random Blues

This was an original piece, located in the same repo [here](https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-zachmiller-ucsb) as linked above (twice!).

To play this piece, run the command ./run.sh tutorials/synthesis/blues.cpp and press 'p'. 

In this piece, I was trying my best to harness randomness to generate convincing solo elements. From choosing the notes in an intentional way (Markov chain-esque) to modifying rhythms, to inverting chords, I tried to pick elements that would lead to an OK sounding solo. Listen and see what you think ;)
